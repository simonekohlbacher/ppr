````shell
# Create package.json file and project configuration
npm init

# Create configuration and install packages for linting
npm init @eslint/config
# Running ESlint - check syntax, find problems, enforce code style of all JavaScript files
npx eslint "**/*.js" # detecting and linting errors as far as possible
npx eslint "**/*.js" --fix # actually fixing errors as far as possible
````

## Build and minify project for production / live system
